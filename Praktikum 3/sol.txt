2: No this will not compile because the compiler doesn't have any clue wether the
object does implement comparable or not (it is not declared)

4: k and v will be replaced by Object
5: yes, "? extends Number" that only types which derive from Number or its derivates are accepted
    -> every Item of the List can use methods from Number (toSting() included)

7: No, a static Method cannot operate on a Class with generic attributes
