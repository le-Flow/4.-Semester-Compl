Part (a):

    Initial State s0s0​:
        Define s0(v)=0 for all variables v. This means every variable has an initial value of 0.

    First Assignment x:=1
        Apply the assignment using C and modify:
        C[[x:=1]](s0)=modify(s0,x,1)
        This updates x to 1 in the new state derived from s0 -> s1
        s1(x)=1 , s1(v)=0 for all v!=x.

    Second Assignment x:=x+1:
        Evaluate x+1 in s1​:
        E[[x+1]](s1)=E[[x]](s1)+1=1+1=2

        Apply the assignment:
        C[[x:=x+1]](s1)=modify(s1,x,2)
        This updates x to 2 in the new state derived from s1​ -> s2
        s2(x)=2 , s2(v)=0 for all v!=x

Part (b):

    Equivalence Explanation:
        The sequence x:=1;x:=x+1 sets x first to 1 and then increments it to 2.
        The assignment x:=2 directly sets x to 2.
        In both cases, the final state for x is 2, and all other variables remain unchanged.
        Therefore, C[[x:=1;x:=x+1;]](s) and C[[x:=2;]](s) are equivalent because both result in the state where x=2 and s(v)=0 for all v!=x,
        regardless of the initial state s.
